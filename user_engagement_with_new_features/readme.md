The project aimed to evaluate the impact of new features introduced on the companyâ€™s platform at the end of 2021 . These features included new courses, exams, and career tracks, which were expected to increase user engagement and profitability in the first half of 2022.<br>

The analysis involved comparing metrics from Q2 2021 and Q2 2022, with students classified as free-plan or paying. Key metrics included total minutes watched and certificates issued, with a focus on paid subscribers.<br>

The data was aggregated and filtered through SQL and then was further analyzed in Python, where outliers were removed, and distribution plots were created. The mean and median minutes watched by students in four groups were calculated, and confidence intervals were determined for each group.<br>

Hypothesis testing was conducted to determine whether the new features contributed to an increase in minutes watched on the platform, indicating increased student engagement. Two-sample t-tests were performed for both free-plan and paying students.<br>

Finally, a correlation analysis was conducted between the minutes watched and the certificates issued, followed by a linear regression using the minutes watched as a predictor and certificates issued as a target. The project provided valuable insights into the effectiveness of the new features in enhancing student engagement.<br>
